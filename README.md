# 44gen
*Satisfy your perfectionism without losing sanity using this automatic stat rolling brute-force tool!*

## How to Use
Open your old-school MapleStory client and enter the character creation page. Set the client to be on windowed mode, with the OG 800x600 resolution. Open CMD as administrator on a path containing the executable and run:

`44gen.exe <MAPLESTORY PID (use task manager to figure it out)> <YOUR SPACE SEPERATED DESIRED MINIMZIED STATS (e.g. STR DEX INT LUK)>`

For example:

`44gen.exe 14504 INT LUK`

Let it do its work without moving your mouse, and enjoy!
